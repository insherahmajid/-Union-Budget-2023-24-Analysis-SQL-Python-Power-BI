## Union Budget 2023‚Äì24 Analysis | SQL + Python + Power BI

##  Project Overview
This project presents a complete **data analytics workflow** using **SQL, Python, and Power BI** to analyze India‚Äôs **Union Budget (FY 2021‚Äì2023)**.  
It covers every step from **data cleaning and transformation** to **exploratory analysis** and **interactive visualization**.

The goal is to identify **trends, growth patterns, and funding priorities** across ministries and government schemes.

##  Project Objectives
- Analyze **Budget Estimates (BE)** for 2022 and 2023.  
- Identify **top ministries and schemes** by allocation.  
- Detect **growth trends** and **underfunded schemes**.  
- Segment schemes by **positive, negative, and zero growth**.  
- Build an **interactive Power BI dashboard** for visual exploration.

##  Data Cleaning (Python)

### Tools: `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`

Performed using Jupyter Notebook (`UnionBudget.ipynb`):

- Imported and inspected CSV file.  
- Cleaned column names and removed redundant fields.  
- Converted numeric columns (`Actuals_2021`, `BE_2022`, `BE_2023`).  
- Calculated new field:
  ```python
  budget['Growth_percent'] = ((budget['BE_2023'] - budget['BE_2022']) / budget['BE_2022']) * 100

-Handled missing values and filtered invalid records.
-Exported the cleaned dataset as unionbudget_cleaned.csv

## Data Analysis (SQL)
**Tools:** PostgreSQL

**Top 10 Ministries by 2023 Budget**
SELECT ministry, SUM(BE_2023) AS Total_2023
FROM union_budget_schemes
GROUP BY ministry
ORDER BY Total_2023 DESC
LIMIT 10;

**Total Schemes per Ministry**
SELECT ministry, COUNT(DISTINCT scheme) AS Total_Schemes
FROM union_budget_schemes
GROUP BY ministry
ORDER BY Total_Schemes DESC;

**Schemes with Positive and Negative Growth**
SELECT scheme, ministry, SUM(Growth_Percent) AS Growth_percentage
FROM union_budget_schemes
GROUP BY scheme, ministry
HAVING SUM(Growth_Percent) > 0
ORDER BY Growth_percentage DESC;

## Visualization (Power BI)

**Tool:** Power BI Desktop
**File:** Union_Budget_2023-24.pbix

| KPI              | Value     |
| ---------------- | --------- |
| Total Schemes    | 710       |
| Total Ministries | 69        |
| Total BE 2022    | ‚Çπ1.18M Cr |
| Total BE 2023    | ‚Çπ1.47M Cr |
| Overall Growth   | 24%       |

**Key Visuals:**
-Top 5 Ministries by 2023 Budget
-Top 5 Schemes by Allocation
-Ministry-wise Comparison (BE 2022 vs BE 2023)
-Growth Category Distribution (Positive, Negative, Zero)
-Sector-wise Spending Trends
